# Movie-Casting-Analyzer-Web-App

Need to create Movie Casting Analyzer user friendly react Web app.
The input data must be loaded from CSV file without help of external libraries for CSV parsing.
On Homepage need to render top actor pair who acted together in most movies. I make algorithm that
search every two actors played together in one movie are they played together in other movies.
Most played actors pair render on home screen. How movies shared, list of movies played together
and two actors names. On moviepage show all movies, click on movie got to detailpage and show info
title, release date, nad cast(actors and their roles, or Unnamed if RoleName is null).
On Actorpage render all actors, click on actor show all movie they acted in and their role (if any) prer movie.

How to start project.

1. First: You need to go to backend folder and start server => 'npm start' in terminal to run the data .csv files.
2. Second: In second split terminal you need to go to 'Movie-Casting-Analyzer-Web-App' folder and start frontend => 'npm run dev' in terminal.
